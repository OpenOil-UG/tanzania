        description: This map layer charts total forest loss from 2000 - 2010.  Deforestation and forest degredation can be caused by multiple factors, both natural and man made. Forest loss surrounding city centers is likely due to urban sprawl; loss patterns in orderly, rectangular grids are likely the result of industrial logging; while loss with no discernable pattern is likely due to natural causes or artisanal logging.
