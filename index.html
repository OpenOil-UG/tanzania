    title: Collaborative Landuse Mapping
    description_short: Moabi is a collaborative mapping platform to monitor landuse planning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Introductory text to the Moabi project, not to be more than a few lines long.  A full consideration of the project should be included in the in about page.  This should be limited to four or five sentences, so as to not lose an audience with a short attention span.
