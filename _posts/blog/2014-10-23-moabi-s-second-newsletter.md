## Moabi's Second Newsletter

After sending the 1st Newsletter edition whose purpose was to introduce the Moabi Project, this  new  edition  gives  you  an  overview  of  new  activities  carried  out  during  the  six  (6) last  months:  you  will  find  the  progress  made  in  the  design  of  the **REDD+ Independent Monitoring system at the project scale, the development of the Moabi platform and the launch of the Moabi map competition as well!**  

Hoping  that  the  summer  break  has  gone  well,  we  wish  you  a  very  good  reading  of  this newsletter and please contact us if you have any questions or comments.


### REDD Independent Monitoring

The Moabi Project aims to design an institutional and a technical process of an IM-REDD and grievance mechanism for REDD+ (IM-REDD) at the national and project scale.

The goals of IM-REDD+ are for: 

1. **Strengthen the enforcement of Congolese laws** and regulations related to REDD+ .
2. **Improve the participation of civil society** 
3. **Ensure quality** of the activities implemented by the REDD project proponents
4. **Enhance activities** developed by the REDD project proponents.

Thus, each **REDD+ stakeholder** (Congolese Administration, civil society, donors, Project Managers) are linked to the IMREDD system and will take advantage from this mechanism.
