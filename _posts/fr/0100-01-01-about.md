# About the Initiative

The "Improving Forest Governance through Independent Monitoring" Project began in July 2013. It is funded by the Norwegian Government Forest and Climate Initiative, with project implementation development from the Austrian-based institute IIASA (The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis). Activities are implemented by two DRC-based NGOs, OSFAC and OGF.

This project is built on outcomes of the Moabi DRC Initiative that took place between June 2011 and June 2013.  Our aim is new to establish Moabi as an independent monitoring system supporting REDD+ implementation at the national and project-level scales.

## Objectives:

1. Develop regular and transparent civil society participation in land use planning.
2. Ensure continuous and regular field monitoring through collaborative mapping.
3. Strengthen REDD+ and natural resource planning using reference levels.

# About the Data

The Moabi platform is built on a clone of [OpenStreetMap](osm.org).  OSM was built as an open source alternative to proprietary geographic data platforms, with voluntary contributions sourced from the crowd.  Ten years later, and with over one million users, OSM provides both a model for how to collect, organize, and redistribute geographic data from disparate sources, as well as the technical tools to store and edit this data.

Cloning the OSM site offers many advantages.  Where appropriate, it allows data to be easily shared between the OSM and Moabi, ensuring that data common to both -- for instance on roads and buildings -- is up-to-date.  Moreover, by establishing a common data schema, it allows for easy read/write access to data from different sources, whether it relates to land use concessions, transportation networks, forest cover, or community reporting.

## Explore the Data

Interact with extensive data on land use in the DRC via the interactive map below. Export a map as a print copy, an embeddable url, or download the raw geographic data.

## Read the Reports

Each user-generated data hub presents specific data and analysis on a single topic. [Browse]({{site.baseurl}}/reports/{{page.language}}) projects to gain an in-depth understanding of the data, or build your own topic using your own data.

# Open for Collaboration

Moabi is built on a clone of the OpenStreetMap project, an open, user-generated map of the world containing geographic data on buildings and navigation. Moabi extends OSM's collaborative model to tackle difficult developmental problems relating to land use planning and natural resource management.
