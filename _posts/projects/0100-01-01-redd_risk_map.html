title: REDD+ Risk
description: Future forest loss in DRC is very uncertain. Decades of conflict and under investment have prevented the industrial scale of forestry and agricultural activities that characterized deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia – the other two large rainforest countries. As the country stabilizes, deforestation will increase, but predicting when and where it will occur presents an ongoing challenge to REDD+ implementation.

  - title: Competition for resources threatens REDD+ implementation
    text: A recent study by the Moabi DRC team has identified 6 existing and proposed land uses that could compete with REDD+ pilot project activities. New infrastructure and extractive industries could cause forest loss that is not currently considered within reference emission levels. Some of these proposed activities are active, many are speculative, but over the next thirty years, many could result in deforestation

  - title: Transport and Energy
    text: Roads and rivers provide the arteries for travel and trade across DRC. After decades of neglect, over twenty-five thousand kilometers of road are being rehabilitated including more than one thousand kilometers directly overlapping with REDD+ pilot projects.  Forest located within two kilometers of roads will be vulnerable to clearance and other impacts such as poaching will affect a far wider area. DRC government also plans to invest <strong>$50 billion</strong> in electricity generation, particularly in hydropower and power transmission.

  - title: Logging
    text: In addition to small-scale logging by local communities, the study identified <strong>nine</strong> logging permits and <strong>thirty-two</strong> artisanal logging licenses currently overlapping REDD+ pilot projects. Illegal logging is rampant and according to a recent study by ……, 94% of logging is illegal.

  - title: Mining
    text: Reflecting DRC’s vast mineral wealth, mining permits cover over <strong>18%</strong> of the DRC’s total land area including over eight thousand square kilometers directly overlapping REDD+ projects. Predicting which permits will become active mines depends upon many factors including market demand, the size and quality of the deposit, and the ease of extracting and transporting minerals to market. Oil and Gas blocks have also been granted across <strong>42%</strong> of DRC’s forest area and overlapping <strong>six</strong> REDD+ pilot projects.

  - title: Indigenous territories
    text: At least <strong>four</strong> REDD+ projects overlap with indigenous territories, which makes their free, prior, and informed consent to these activities critical. REDD+ as well as other proposed land uses overlap with customary rights of local communities and could impede their access and use of the forest. Pygmy communities, in particular, are increasingly vulnerable to illegal loggers, artisanal miners, and slash and burn agriculture. Their customary rights are not recognized under DRC law and few of their customary rights have been mapped.

Forest loss surrounding city centers is likely due to urban sprawl; loss patterns in orderly, rectangular grids are likely the result of industrial logging; while loss with no discernable pattern is likely due to natural causes or artisanal logging.
