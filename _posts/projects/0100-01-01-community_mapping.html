title: Community Mapping
description: Future forest loss in DRC is very uncertain. Decades of conflict and under investment have prevented the industrial scale of forestry and agricultural activities that characterized deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia â€“ the other two large rainforest countries. As the country stabilizes, deforestation will increase, but predicting when and where it will occur presents an ongoing challenge to REDD+ implementation.

    title: Community Participation in Project Monitoring
    description: For a country as large and diverse as the DRC, active community consent and participation will be essential for any successful landuse monitoring project.  In January 2014, Crowdcover partnered with '########' and '#######' to lead community mapping projects in '#####.'  The data, collected by local participants via SMS and Smart Phone, records the level of regional familiarity with the REDD process and also locates specific instances of illegal logging.  View the results in the project data panel.

After decades of neglect, 16,760 kilometers of road are being rehabilitated including 820 kilometers directly overlapping with REDD+ pilot projects.  Forest located within two kilometers of roads will be vulnerable to clearance and other impacts such as poaching will affect a far broader area.
