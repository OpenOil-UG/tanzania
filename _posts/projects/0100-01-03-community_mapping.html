    title: Community Participation in Project Monitoring
    description: For a country as large and diverse as the DRC, active community consent and participation will be essential for any successful landuse monitoring project.  In January 2014, Crowdcover partnered with '########' and '#######' to lead community mapping projects in '#####.'  The data, collected by local participants via SMS and Smart Phone, records the level of regional familiarity with the REDD process and also locates specific instances of illegal logging.  View the results in the project data panel.
