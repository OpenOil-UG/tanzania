# How to Use Moabi

The Moabi site is built as a collaborative platform to allow users to interact with the complex dynamics of land use planning and environmental management in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  For users that wish to edit or analyze the underlying data, there are two different tracks to do so.  **Editors** interact with the database directly in order to upload, edit, and maintain the geographic data; editor guides are available for [uploading]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}) and [editing]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}) data.  **Reporters** author short to medium-length reports to discuss and share key environmental and land use dynamics contained in the maps; reporter guides are available for [authoring reports]({{site.baseurl}}/author-reports/{{page.language}}).

Moabi also includes tools to make, interact with, and share maps and reports.
