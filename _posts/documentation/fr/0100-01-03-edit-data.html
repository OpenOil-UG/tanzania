# Edit Data

***

*This tutorial covers editing and updating data already loaded onto Moabi.  If you are looking to upload data that does not yet exist on Moabi, see the* [Upload Data Tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}/).


Moabi uses the **iD editor** to edit existing data.  With iD, users can:

1. update map feature attributes,
2. add new attributes to features,
3. improve the geometry of features,
4. add new traced features.

All edits happen within the browser, so as long as your browser is up to date, you will not need to download any additional software.

## Getting Started

On either the [Map Page]({{site.baseurl}}/data/{{page.langauge}}/) or any of the [Reports Pages]({{site.baseurl}}/reports/{{page.language}}), click on the **edit button** in the top right of the sidebar to navigate to the iD editor page.

### Sign Up/Sign In

If you have not already done so, you will be prompted to **sign up** or **sign in**.

<!-- ![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14352920173_a14df46d9a_o.png) -->

Enter your email, username, a password and click **Sign Up**.  You will need to confirm your account by email and agree to the **Terms of Service**, stating simply that all data will be [licensed]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing/{{page.language}}/) in the public domain.  Moabi is built as a clone of the open source **OpenStreetMap** project; much of the look and feel of the site still reflects OSM.

### Exploring the Map

Click and hold on the map to pan.  To zoom in, either click the **+** button in the top right, double click on a location in the map, scroll up while your cursor is over the map, or hold *shift* and click to draw a bounding box over the map.  To zoom out, click the **-** button or scroll down.

To view a map data layer, click on the <span class="idcon layers"></span> **layers** button and select that layer.

<!-- The **Moabi Browse Page** opens up a host of advanced functionality for examining a map feature, including its history, its entire attribute list, and its OSM XML structure.  To learn more about the underlying data model, go to the [Advanced Funtionality Page]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced-funtionality/{{page.language}}).  If instead you simply want to explore one or more map layers, go to the [Map Data Page]({{site.baseurl}}/data/{{page.language}}) -->



## Editing data

Editing data can follow one of two similar possible paths:

1. Updating existing features

2. Trace new features by hand


***

### Updating Existing Features

If data already in the Moabi database is outdated, incomplete, or incorrect, it is possible to update the feature within the browser.  Having the tools to easily update geometry and attribute information within the browser makes collaborating on large datasets comparatively easy.  Some things to keep in mind, though.  In order to be editable, all on-screen features need to be loaded into the browser.  In order to not crash your browser, data is only editable at zoom level **14** or higher.

1. In this example, imagine we learned that the reference name of one of the roads in the **Road Rehabilitation** layer was incorrect.  First, open the map **Layers** tab <span class="idcon layers" style="margin-top: 3px"></span> and select the **Transport** layer.  Zoom to **zoom level 14** on the feature you want to edit, or click **Zoom to Edit**.

1. Once you are at zoom level 14 or higher, data will be editable.  Click on a feature to view and edit information on that feature's attributes.  For example, here we can update this road's **Reference** tag if we found that this was out of date.

1. To edit a feature's geometry, click and drag that feature's nodes.  For example, with the satellite layer as reference, notice how our road feature is not quite aligned correctly.  By dragging all mis-aligned nodes to their correct location, users can greatly improve the precision of their geometries and correct incorrect geometries.

### Tracing New Features

Using the **iD Editor's** satellite layer, users can easily define new features, either as <span class="idcon point"></span> **points**, <span class="idcon line"></span> **lines**, or <span class="idcon polygon"></span> **polygons**, and specify their attributes.

1. In this example, imagine we found evidence of logging roads that were not already in the database. (*for more on tracing and dating logging roads, see [our training]({{site.baseurl}}/EcoHackathon/{{page.language}}) we led with the World Resource Institute at the May 2014 EcoHackathon and the accompanying [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/EcoHacking-DRC-Logging-Roads/{{page.language}})*)  Within the **iD editor**, navigate to your area of interest and zoom in until the editing buttons at the top of the map are no longer grayed out.

2. Click the <span class="idcon line"></span>**line** button and start tracing.  Click once on the map to start the line, click again to create a line vertex, and click that vertex again to finish tracing that line.

3. When you have finished tracing a feature, the attribute definition box appears, with some default attributes already visible (in this case, Road, Power Line, and Line).  If your feature is not already shown, search for it in the search bar at the top.  In this case, we choose **unclassified road** from the **road** dropdown.

4. Next, add additional optional tags (*read more about optional tags [here]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}})*).  In this case, we add the optional tag `logging = yes`.

5. If you are satisfied with your edits, click the **Save** button at the top and add a brief commit message describing what you edited.  If you think you made a mistake, click the undo button or simply refresh the page.

### Adding Undocumented Data

If in updating or creating a new feature you add any optional attributes that are not documented in the [map feature documentation page]({{site.baseurl}}/map-features/{{page.language}}), these new attributes should likely be added to the documentation page.  For instance, if you added an `max_speed` attribute to a road, which is not currently being tracked in the documentation, it should be added to the documentation page.
