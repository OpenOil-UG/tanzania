# Author Reports

A powerful tool of the Moabi platform is the ability to author, publish and share reports using any of the data layers available on the database.  Reports are short to medium-length articles that highlight key aspects of the data collected on the platform -- for example, our debut report on [risk drivers for UN REDD+](http://rdc.moabi.org/redd_risk/en/).  Anyone can read and share these reports, and anyone who has signed up for a free user account can author these reports using our simple in-browser authoring tools.

To begin with, check out the already-published reports on the **[reports page]({{site.baseurl}}/reports/{{page.language}})**.

To write a report, click the **Author Reports** button.  If you are not already logged in, you will be asked to do so, or to create a new profile.


## Describe Your Map

To get started, begin by giving your report a news-worthy title and a one paragraph description, both of which will appear on the **reports page**.  You can also choose a customized banner image to better contextualize your report by replacing the **Background Image URL** with your own image url.  This image can be hosted anywhere on the web, including any number of free image hosting services like **[flickr](www.flickr.com)**.


## Select Map Layers

From the complete list of map layers, select the layers that make sense in the context of your story.  Simply drag and drop them from the above to the below box.

This could be as few or as many as you want.  Any data layer that helps illustrate what you are reporting on should be included; irrelevant layers are more likely to distract and probably shouldn't be included.


## Write Your Report

Reports consist of a number of pages, each with some short text and an optional **event** triggered when the page is viewed.  Events can navigate to specific places on the map and/or add map data layers.

Begin by adding a title and description, using **markdown** if necessary.  To create an **event** for this page, click on **Set**.

Select layers from the checkboxes in the lower right to have them appear when this page is being viewed.  Navigate to anywhere on the map to have the page zoom to that location when viewed.  In the above case, this page will zoom in on the town of **Bongandanga**, with the **palm oil** and **logging concession** layers visible.

Subsequent pages can have new and different events all their own, adding context to the content you write.  To add a new blank page, click **Add New Section**.

When you are done, writing your report, click **Save** to publish.
