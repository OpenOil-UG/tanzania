          Within the Moabi database, all vector features have a **geometry type** that defines if that feature is a single point, a line, or a polygon.  Additional, non-geometric information about each feature is defined by a standardized set of **attributes**.


          ## Geometry Types
          All features can be of one of three **types**: <span class="idcon point"></span>**point**, <span class="idcon line"></span>**line**, or <span class="idcon polygon"></span>**polygon**, similar to most GIS programs.  It is possible for some features to be represented in different types.  For instance, a small concession could either be represented as a point marking the concession center, or as a polygon outlining its boundary.


          ## Attributes
          All features are defined by a series of different attributes (aka *tags*) that contain additional information about a feature.  Attributes are a pairing of a **key** and a **value**, again similar to most GIS programs.  There are three types of attributes in the Moabi platform.  To learn more about attribute naming conventions, see the tutorial on [uploading data]({{site.baseurl}}/upload-data/{{page.language}}).

          ### PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES
          All features have one primary attribute that defines what they are.  For example, all mining concessions must have the attribute `concession=mine`, while all logging concessions must have the attribute `concession=logging`.

          ### OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES
          Additionally, features can have zero or more optional attributes that signify additional information about that feature.  For example, a mine can be given an `operator={text}` attribute representing its owner/operator, a `resource={text}` attribute representing the mineral(s) being mined, as well as a number of other attributes.

          ### DEFAULT ATTRIBUTES
          All features are also given automatically generated default attributes, depending on their **feature type**.  For example, the platform will calculate an area for all **polygons**, a length for all **lines**, and a province and district location for all features (**point**, **line**, and **polygon**).  Because of this, it is not necessary to include information on area, length, or administrative location when uploading or editing feature attributes.
