        <h1 class="pad2y">About the Project</h1>
        <p>The "Improving Forest Governance through Independent Monitoring" Project began in July 2013. It is funded by the Norwegian Government Forest and Climate Initiative, with project implementation developement from the Austiran-based institute IIASA (The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis). Activities are implemented by two Congolese NGOs, OSFAC and OGF.</p>

        <p>This project is built on the results of the Moabi Project that took place between June 2011 and June 2013.  The aim of this new project is to establish an independent monitoring system to support REDD+ implementation at the national and project-level scales.</p>

        <p>There are currently three objectives:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Develop regular and transparent civil society participation in land use planning.</li>
            <li>Ensure continuous and regular field monitoring through collaborative mapping.</li>
            <li>Strengthen REDD+ and Natural Resource planning using reference levels.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1 class="pad2y">About the Data</h1>
        <p>The Moabi platform is built on a clone of the <a href="#">OpenStreetMap</a> project.  OSM was built as an open source alternative to proprietary geographic data platforms, with voluntary contributions sourced from the crowd.  Ten years later, and with over one million users, OSM provides both a model for how to collect, organize, and redistribute geographic data from disparate sources, as well as the technical tools to store and edit this data.</p>

        <p>Cloning the OSM site offers many advantages.  Where appropriate, it allows data to be easily shared between the OSM and Moabi, ensuring that data common to both -- for instance on roads and buildings -- is up-to-date.  Moreover, by establishing a common data schema, it allows for easy read/write access to data from different sources, whether it relates to land use concessions, transportation networks, forest cover, or community reporting.</p>
