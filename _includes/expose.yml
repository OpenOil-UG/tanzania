# This rather clunky code allows any page with a page_ref to reference another page with a page_key
# based on a match between ref and key.  The referencing page will inherit all front matter THAT IS USED
# WITHIN THE PAGE (i.e not variables like 'categories' or 'permalink' that are referenced via {{site.var}} from the
# referenced page, unless any of those values are explicitly overwritten by the referencing page.
# This allows any page in english/french to borrow directly from its french/english counterpart, so that
# only content needing translation would need to be defined in the frontmatter.

# In each layout, all page variables are accessed via {{var}}, NOT {{page.var}}

# expose.yml must include an {% assign ... %} command for each base node that is to be referencable itself
# or is to have one of its child nodes be referencable
